    <h2>My Note for You</h2>
    <p>
      Happy Birthday, My Love!<br><br>
      Today, I want you to know just how deeply you mean to me. Not a day goes by when I don’t realize how lucky I am to have you in my life. You are not only the love of my life but my queen, my best friend, and my greatest inspiration.<br><br>
      With every beat of my heart, I cherish you more than words can say. You’re my constant source of strength, laughter, and joy, and I want you to know that my loyalty to you is unwavering. I trust you more than anything in this world, and I’m grateful every day for the trust you place in me. I can’t imagine a single second without you by my side, so please don’t ever leave me alone. I need you, and I promise to always be the one to make you happy and keep you smiling.<br><br>
      On this special day, I make you a promise — to love you with all I have, every single day, and to stand by you no matter what. I vow to always keep you happy, to support your dreams, and to respect you. I promise never to hold you back but to be the partner who stands by your side through it all, as we build our future together. You’ll always be my queen, and I’ll cherish and protect you forever.<br><br>
      Happy birthday to the one who makes my heart whole. Today and forever, I love you beyond measure. You are my forever, and I look forward to every moment we have ahead.<br><br>
      With all my heart
